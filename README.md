# SchoolOfWhales-Wordpress

Word Press Exercise:
Create a new blank WordPress theme. There should be only one page displaying all posts from a
custom post type called Press, similar to the press page in our website. The admin should be able
to input Article Name, Publisher Name and Link to the article. No frontend framework is
required, use jQuery if needed.
You will submit your code via email using the link to your GitHub repository. Please be
prepared to walk us through how you did the exercise and what tools you used.
